            <p>Hello World! A new Web/Software Developer in training here. I was born in China and came to U.S since I was 18. I was a classic Chinese boy when back in China- Spent a lot of time focus on school stuff but my grade is never reach 95 or below 70. Japanese Anime and American Hero moive are my favorites. A Web/software Developer always sounds fashion and mysterious. 
                I studied a little bit html and C language in highschool and found lots of fun. However, the computer language can only be considered as hobby which did nothing to my grade. I have to bury the ideal and keep struggling on "proper business".
        
        
              </p>  
              <p>Fastforward to present, after 5 years been in Accountant and 5 years as Marketing, I'am gradtefully to find another chance to countinue my dream here at GT Bootcamp. The past week gave me lots of problem and puzzle to solve, but I kinda enjoy it. 
                After building this my really first webpage, I feel like a new Web Developer is coming to my family!
